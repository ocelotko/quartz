## Overview

Quartz is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) application built using the Matrix chat protocol. Matrix is an open network for secure, decentralized communication. Our application leverages Matrix to provide a robust and scalable P2P messaging system that ensures privacy, security, and resilience against central points of failure.

## Features

- Decentralized Communication: No central server; all communication is peer-to-peer.
- Secure Messaging: End-to-end encryption for all messages.
- Scalability: Efficient and scalable network architecture.
- Resilience: High availability and fault tolerance.
- Interoperability: Compatible with other Matrix-based clients and servers.
